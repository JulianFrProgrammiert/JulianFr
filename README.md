Hi, my name is Julian Fridland.
I'm a beginner web developer from Germany. I am already familiar with the technologies HTML and CSS, like Node.js and design with Canva. Currently I'm learning JS and TS with the frameworks Angular, React, Vue and Git. I have already implemented some projects and will upload them.
